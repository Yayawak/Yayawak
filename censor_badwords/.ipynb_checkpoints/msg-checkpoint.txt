Oh, black Persian cat!
Oh, black Persian Cat!
Oh, black Persian cAt!
Oh, black Persian cAT!
Oh, black Persian CAT!


Was not your life
already cursed with offspring?
We took you for rest to that old
Yankee farm, — so lonely
and with so many field mice
in the long grass —
and you return to us
in this condition, Catalina!
